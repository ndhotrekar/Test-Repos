## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Create a stacked bar chart
# Create the input vectors.
colors <- c("green","orange")
region <- c("Africa","Americas","SE Asia","Europe","East. Med","Western Pacific")
gender <- c("Male","Female")

# Create the matrix of the values.
Values <- matrix(c(11013,42350,58209,83049,14189,279139,8890,28807,28190,55462,7749,132760),nrow = 2,ncol = 6,byrow = TRUE)

# Create the bar chart.
barplot(Values,main = "Stomach Cancer Deaths by Gender and WHO Regions",names.arg = region,xlab = "WHO Region",ylab = "Stomach Cancer Deaths",
        col = colors)

# Add the legend to the chart.
legend("topleft", gender, cex = 0.9, fill = colors)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
